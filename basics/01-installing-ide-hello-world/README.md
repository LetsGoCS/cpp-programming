# 1. Installing CodeBlocks IDE, HelloWorld Program

## Concept

Our goal: write C/C++ code program and execute it.

Compiler: software that transforms source code from a programming language to another.
Compiler is mostly used to translate from a higher level programming language to a lower level.

High-level programming language: easier for human to understand (may use natural language elements) e.g. C/C++.

Low-level programming language: easier for machine (computer) to understand e.g. machine code.

IDE (Integrated development environment):  software that provides facilities for software development. IDE may consists of a source code editor, intelligent code completion, etc. Examples: Microsoft Visual Studio, NetBeans, Eclipse, etc.

We will use [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) (free, open-source cross-platform IDE that supports multiple compilers).
